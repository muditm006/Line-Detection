The objective is to code a program that when inputted an image of two parallel lines, will process it, find the center of the two lines and the direction of travel, and return the image with the direction of travel indicated with an arrow. The program will be written using several imported libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Math, and build in methods including cv2.Hough_Lines() (for creating and overlaying the line), Hough_Gradient() (for identifying the lines), and cv2.getPerspective() and related libraries to work with the 3D pictures transformations. All libraries are native to Python.
